			<h3>About Me!</h3>
			<p>
I'm Alyssa Sallean and I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Texas in Austin!

Growing up, I had many different interests such as Sewing and Music, but as I grew older I learned to appreciate academa on a much deeper level than had anticipated; I found my passion lied in Computer Science.

I've worked on various projects over the many years that I've been doing this, from silly high school projects to one of the most interesting and exciting programming jobs of my life. I've spent this past summer (Summer 2013), working for an ETRM (Energy Trading Risk Management) software company. Though the GUI needs some work (1992 graphics are a bit out of style), Openlink offers the best solution for oil and gas companies around the world. I mostly focused on the Custom Solutions side, companies who buy our software who need small changes (which end up being not so small) and I've really enjoyed seeing how a product goes from start to finish and how to contribute to a team in a professional setting.

During my time at school, and when I'm not Skyping with my boyfriend in Boston, you can pretty much always find me in the Computer Lab on campus. I've gotten to know quite a few really, really swell and smart computer scientists much like myself who have made my experience at UT one of the most fun experiences of my life.
